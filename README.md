# Pearson-s-correlation-coefficient-T---Students-
Small program that studies the correlation between two data columns using the Pearson correlation coefficient and the confidence intervals of the t-students tables.

The "datos.csv" file contains the columns that are going to be studied to see if they are correlated. The columns should be arranged in the same way as shown in the example.

The "t-students.csv" file contains the T-Students tables that program uses to find the correlation percentage of two columns from "data.csv" file have.

If the program is executed, it will return a print with the correlation values between the two columns in addition to the values of the different statistics used in the process.
